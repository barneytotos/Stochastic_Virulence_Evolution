## intro

- parasite evolution: what do we really know?
    - tradeoff theory popular, but many complexities (multilevel selection, short-sighted evolution, etc.)
    - heritable traits affecting fitness - so must evolve!
	- start from scratch (more or less)
- traditional/more common approaches: shortcuts
    - e.g. find ESS, adaptive dynamics, "Price equation"
	- (ref Abrams paper?)
- parallel with/inspiration from nearly neutral theory

## part 1: no tradeoff

- transmission evolution: runaway positive selection
    - depends on scale of parameter!
	- mutational spectrum

## part 2: tradeoffs

a. tradeoff model (1-dimension)
    - 
b. efficiency (2-dimensions, alpha + beta) [stabilizing + directional]
c. tuning model (2-dimensions, alpha + phi) [stabilizing + stabilizing]: multiple controls on exploitation rate?

## discussion

### caveats/simplifications:

- fixed host population size
- no resistance/tolerance
- independent mutation (diagonal G matrix)
- SIS model, SIR + vital dynamics with strong density-dependence

### dynamics

- eco-evo
- stochastic effects
- finite-population size

### biology

- mutation, selection, drift
- mutational meltdown?
