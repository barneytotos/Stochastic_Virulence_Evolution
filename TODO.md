## Morgan

* ~~get model "2B" (efficiency, zero correlation) running on Stanford cluster~~
* Update "vir_evo_stochas_eff_bulk.R" so that it can run in parallel on Stanford cluster
* Combine get_mut and update_mut_pt
* List of naming updates (I like the positive_trait, negative_trait idea, but should integrate it throughout)
  - alpha and gamma depending on the model
  - SIR vs host_mort vs host resistance and tolerance evolution or no

## Ben
 
* poke around in sim code, try to understand it, document/clean up -- figure out what stands in the way of reducing it to a no-tradeoff model ...?
* naming conventions: "recovery" <-> "alpha"
