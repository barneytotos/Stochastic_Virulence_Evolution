## Morgan

* ~~get model "2B" (efficiency, zero correlation) running on Stanford cluster~~
* Update "vir_evo_stochas_eff_bulk.R" so that it can run in parallel on Stanford cluster
* ~~Combine get_mut and update_mut_pt~~
* ~~List of naming updates (I like the positive_trait, negative_trait idea, but should integrate it throughout)~~
  - ~~alpha and gamma depending on the model~~
  - SIR vs host_mort vs host resistance and tolerance evolution or no

## Someone

* test deterministic cases
* what do we need to get ensembles (rather than summaries) back? Or more quantiles?
* house of cards mutation model for no-tradeoff case?
* structure:
    * top level - analyses for the paper
	    * R files here are the specific runs we want to do
		* maybe separate directory for analyses/, outputs/ (however you prefer)
	* pkg/ (hpevosim/ or whatever we want to call the package): http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/
	    * DESCRIPTION, etc.
	    * R/  
		     * move all generic R code to here; distinguishing between `funs_SIS.R` and `funs_SIR.R` ?
             * adding roxygen-style docs
			 * deciding which functions get exported (i.e. which are internal utilities vs end-user functions)
		* man/ [generated by devtools::document()]
