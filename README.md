# Stochastic Virulence Evolution

### Models for the stochastic evolution of parasite virulence

This repository contains work by Morgan Kain, Ben Bolker and Marta Wayne work on virulence evolution in the presence and absence of transmission-virulence tradeoffs, mutation (and mutational biases), and drift. (Earlier work is stored in an unpublished, private repository --- please email for access/more info); the most recent publicly available version of this work is in [my PhD thesis from McMaster University](http://hdl.handle.net/11375/24586).

* For some results from Ben and Marta's work see <a href="https://github.com/morgankain/Stochastic_Virulence_Evolution/blob/master/nn1.html"> here </a>
* For more results from my thesis chapter see <a href="https://github.com/morgankain/Stochastic_Virulence_Evolution/blob/master/Chapter5_revised.pdf"> here </a>

To run code, open `top_level_script.R` and work from there. Note: the code contained in this repository has not yet been fully commented for use by others and remains a work in progress.

1. Ben Bolker's code remains in a separate (private) repository. If you are accessing this repo by scanning my poster at EEID, a summary of some of the results from Ben and Marta's work is available as an html here, but the code is not present.
2. A few parameters ("knobs") are suboptimally incorporated and can override others currently 
3. Pipeline is not fully streamlined. Work script-by-script from `top_level_script.R`.
4. Host resistance and tolerance is included but if set to evolve, evolves without constraint to infinite resistance and tolerance.
