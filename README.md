# Stochastic Virulence Evolution
### Models for the stochastic evolution of parasite virulence

This repository is an extension of Ben Bolker and Marta Wayne's work on "Nearly Neutral" virulence evolution (unpublished, private repository --- please email for access/more info) for one of the four data chapters in my thesis (as of June 2, 2019 the last minor revisions are being completed, the full thesis will be searchable <a href="https://macsphere.mcmaster.ca/"> here </a> soon).

* For some results from Ben and Marta's work see <a href="https://github.com/morgankain/Stochastic_Virulence_Evolution/blob/master/nn1.html"> here </a>
* For more results from my thesis chapter see <a href="https://github.com/morgankain/Stochastic_Virulence_Evolution/blob/master/Chapter5_revised.pdf"> here </a>

To run code, open top_level_script.R and work from there. Note: the code contained in this repository has not yet been fully commented for use by others and remains a work in progress.
 1) Ben Bolker's code remains in a separate (private) repository. If you are accessing this repo by scanning my poster at EEID, a summary of some of the results from Ben and Marta's work is available as an html here, but the code is not present.
 2) A few parameters (knobs) are suboptimally incorporated and can override others currently 
 3) Pipeline is not fully streamlined. Work script by script from top_level_script.R
 4) Host resistance and tolerance is included but if set to evolve, evolves without constraint to infinite resistance and tolerance.
